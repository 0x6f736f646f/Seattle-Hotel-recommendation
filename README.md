# Seattle-Hotel-recommendation
We would like to recommend hotels based on the hotels that a user has already booked or viewed using the cosine similarity. We would recommend hotels with the largest similarity to the ones previously booked or viewed or showed interest by the user. Our recommender system is highly dependent on defining an appropriate similarity measure. Eventually, we select a subset of hotels to display to the user or to determine an order in which to display the hotels.
